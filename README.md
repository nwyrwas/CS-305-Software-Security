# 🔐 **CS-305 Software Security: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment**

Welcome to the **CS-305 Software Security** repository! In this project, I worked on ensuring the **security of Artemis Financial's software**, a financial services company, by identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. The primary goal was to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensure that the system remains secure under all circumstances.

## 📚 **Project Overview**

Artemis Financial offers comprehensive financial solutions to its customers, but with the nature of financial transactions, securing their systems is paramount. The project involved identifying vulnerabilities in their software, testing for potential breaches, and refactoring the code to improve its security. This project was crucial in eliminating weak points that could potentially be exploited by hackers, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of Artemis Financial’s services.

### **Key Project Goals:**
- **Secure Data Transfer**: Ensuring secure data transmission between users.
- **Vulnerability Testing**: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in the software.
- **Eliminating False Positives**: Running repeated tests to ensure that vulnerabilities are accurately identified and eliminated.
- **Enhancing System Credibility**: Securing the software to build trust and credibility with customers, which is critical for retaining and attracting clients in the financial sector.

## 🛡️ **Security Measures Implemented**

- **SSL Certificate**: Added to encrypt data transfers and prevent unauthorized access.
- **HTTP POST Requests**: Implemented for secure data transmission between clients and the server.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: I used various tools to perform vulnerability scanning on the system and identify weak points that could be exploited.
- **Code Refactoring**: Refactored the code to fix identified vulnerabilities and improve its overall security.

## 🧪 **Vulnerability Assessment Process**

### **Challenges Encountered:**
The vulnerability assessment involved a deep dive into the system's security, but one significant challenge was handling **false positives**. False positives can give a misleading impression of a vulnerability being present when it actually isn’t, which could lead to unnecessary efforts being spent on fixing non-issues. To combat this, I generated an **SSL certificate** and used **HTTP POST requests** to ensure secure communication. I then ran thorough tests to identify any false positives and confirmed that each vulnerability identified was valid.

### **Future Mitigation:**
To continue improving the security of the system, the next steps in the vulnerability assessment process include:
1. **Eliminating False Positives**: Running additional tests to ensure that the system is free from false positives and that only real vulnerabilities are being addressed.
2. **Refining Security Measures**: Ensuring all security features are configured correctly to avoid any potential vulnerabilities slipping through the cracks.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Setting up continuous monitoring systems to detect new vulnerabilities as they emerge, and applying timely patches.

## 📝 **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

A key deliverable from this project was the **Vulnerability Assessment Report**, which provides an in-depth analysis of the identified vulnerabilities and the steps taken to resolve them. This report:
- **Demonstrates secure coding practices**: I ensured that best practices for secure coding were followed to eliminate potential weak points.
- **Highlights critical vulnerabilities**: The report identifies critical vulnerabilities and describes the steps taken to mitigate them.
- **Showcases my skills**: The report reflects my knowledge of software security, including my ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks.

## 🔧 **Tools & Technologies Used**

- **Eclipse IDE**: For running and testing the project, as well as handling the code refactoring process.
- **SSL Certificate**: For securing data transfer.
- **HTTP POST Requests**: To ensure secure communication between clients and the server.
- **Security Vulnerability Scanners**: Various tools used for scanning and identifying security weaknesses in the software.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for managing code changes and tracking progress.

## 📈 **Future Work & Enhancements**

- **Advanced Security Features**: Implementing multi-factor authentication and encryption for sensitive data.
- **Extended Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous vulnerability scanning to ensure long-term system integrity.
- **Refinement of User Access Control**: Adding more granular controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive financial data.
